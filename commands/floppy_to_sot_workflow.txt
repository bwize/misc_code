1. edit the following to add new columns:

	~/code/git/mindmixer_science/propdata/views/census (broadband) ♕ vi columns.txt 

2. run the test to make sure the sql is correct

	~/code/git/mindmixer_science/propdata/commands (broadband) ♕ sh runtest.sh
	it will hang after COPY 51, ctrl-C out of it.

3. if it is successful, run the following:

	~/code/git/mindmixer_science/propdata/commands (broadband) ♕ vi generate-census-mviews-then-transfer.sh 

4. make sure census_only_transfer_list.txt  is in the generate-census-mviews-then-transfer.sh instead of the floppy-to-sot-transferlist

	~/code/git/mindmixer_science/propdata/commands (broadband) ♕ sh generate-census-mviews-then-transfer.sh 
	this will drop and recreate all views... it will take a while
